# **SerialCommunication**
### __Simplifies communication with arduino, esp32 and other such boards__

## Use: simpleCommunicator.py:  
Instantiate a simpleCommunicator object  <br/>
    port is a string representing the address of the COM port you're board is connected to you're computer with  
    For example: if connected on COM port 7, would use "\\\\.\\COM7"  
    __An easy way to check the address of you're port is to check what port you're Arduino IDE autodetects you're board to be on__
